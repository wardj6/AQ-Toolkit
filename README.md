# AQ-Toolkit

The AQ Toolkit was originally developed by Jack McKew of AECOM. 
I have maintained development since Jack left AECOM in 2020 and have added several new functions to the toolkit as the need has arisen since.

The Toolkit employs useful function for the processing and analysis of air dispersion modelling inputs and outputs.
